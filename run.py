''' TODO 
Write a Python script named run.py to process the text files (001.txt, 003.txt ...) from the supplier-data/descriptions directory. The script should turn the data into a JSON dictionary by adding all the required fields, including the image associated with the fruit (image_name), and uploading it to http://[linux-instance-external-IP]/fruits using the Python requests library.
